# Small Image Tool


I like simple programs, that do one thing only and are easy to use. Even better if you don't have to install anything. Also modern Browsers are pretty powerful. So here is a simple one-file web app for removing image backgrounds, cropping, and erasing â€” runs entirely in your browser, no installation required.

## How to Use

1. **Download** the HTML file from this repository (e.g. `Small_Image_Tool.html`).
2. **Double-click** it â€” it will open in your default browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - No setup, no Node.js, no Python. Just one file.
3. **Upload an image** with the file selector.
4. Use the tools:
   - **Color Remover** â†’ click on a color in the image, adjust **Threshold** (range of colors) and **Feather** (softness), then **Apply**.
   - **Brush Erase / Restore** â†’ paint transparency or restore parts of the image (hold **Space** to toggle temporarily).
   - **Crop / Delete Rect** â†’ crop the image to a rectangle or make a selected area transparent.
   - **Undo / Redo** â†’ buttons or shortcuts (`Ctrl/Cmd+Z`, `Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+Z`).
5. When youâ€™re done, click **Download PNG** to save your edited image with transparency.

##  Privacy & Security

- Everything runs **locally in your browser**.
- **No images are uploaded** â€” your files never leave your computer.
- Works offline
